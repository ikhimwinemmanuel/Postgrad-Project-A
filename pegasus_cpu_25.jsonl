We first investigate if DL algorithms can\nidentify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or\notherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate\nwhether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model\nperformance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a\nquantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different\nbrain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.\nThrough these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet\nand SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based\nshortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification.

Nonetheless, ECO faces constraints due\nto an imbalance between exploitation and exploration, rendering it susceptible\nto local optima and demonstrating restricted effectiveness in addressing\ncomplex optimization problems. To address these limitations, this study\npresents an enhanced educational competition optimizer (IECO-MCO) utilizing\nmulti-covariance learning operators. In IECO, three distinct covariance\nlearning operators are introduced to improve the performance of ECO. Each\noperator effectively balances exploitation and exploration while preventing\npremature convergence of the population. The effectiveness of IECO is assessed\nthrough benchmark functions derived from the CEC 2017 and CEC 2022 test suites,\nand its performance is compared with various basic and improved algorithms\nacross different categories. The results demonstrate that IECO-MCO surpasses\nthe basic ECO and other competing algorithms in convergence speed, stability,\nand the capability to avoid local optima. Furthermore, statistical analyses,\nincluding the Friedman test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test,\nare conducted to validate the superiority of IECO-MCO over the compared\nalgorithms. Compared with the basic algorithm (improved algorithm), IECO-MCO\nachieved an average ranking of 2.213 (2.488) on the CE2017 and CEC2022 test\nsuites. Additionally, the practical applicability of the proposed IECO-MCO\nalgorithm is verified by solving constrained optimization problems.

In\nthis work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from\naligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature\nrepresentations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and\nconduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their\ndiscriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability\nfor video feature alignment.

Quantization reduces memory through lower\nnumerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic\nperformance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as\nQuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before\nquantization, using computational invariance: $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{Wx} =\n(\\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\\mathbf{Q}$. However, these\nmethods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case\ncoherence $\\mu = 1/\\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight\ndistributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct\noutlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than\none-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces\nHadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by\ncontinuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\\{+1, -1\\}$\nentries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning,\nbutterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization\nwhile guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint\nensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \\log\nn)$ computational complexity with only $\\frac{n \\log n}{2}$ learnable\nparameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on\npost-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to\nquantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in\nminutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost.

Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can\ncomplete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact\nthat marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential\nimprovements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,\nwe argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from\nmistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating\nexecution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to\nsolve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute\nsignificantly more turns even when small models have 100\\% single-turn\naccuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the\nnumber of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --\ncuriously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely\nto make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.\nSelf-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,\nrecent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer\ntasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on\nthe length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on\nthe ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve\ncomplex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and\nhighlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time\ncompute for long-horizon tasks.", "generated_summary": "In our latest paper, we show how scaling model size can lead to exponential gains over long-horizon tasks.", "model_name": "google/pegasus-xsum", "time_sec": 15.397, "gpu_mem_bytes": 0, "input_tokens": 512, "output_tokens": 24}

Despite substantial progress enabled by\nlarge-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two\nfundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale\nhuman-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited\ngeneralization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in\nLarge Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can\ndramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural\nquestion: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action\nplanning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL\nframework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce\nVLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment\nrendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT,\nSimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\\pi_0$\non RoboTwin 1.0\\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce.\nSimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust\ngeneralization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks.\nMoreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training,\nwherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in\nthe previous training process.
